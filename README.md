# foodAPP
A react-native application build using expo-cli and json-server for resturant booking and other resturant related features.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm install json-server -g`
Make a directory where you want to make your db then run this command. then place the **db.json** file into that folder. The file will then serve as a db to your app.

### `json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000`
With this command you will be able to access your db with endpoints like ***dishes*** | ***comments*** | ***promotions*** | ***leaders*** | ***feedback***. Since your react application will be running on 3000 thats why we have assigned 3001 to access json-server.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `expo start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
expo servise will start in browser.<br />
The app will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
